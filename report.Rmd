The Big Five personality dimensions are a well known concept from the field of psychology.
They are Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness. \
As part of the Data Analysis course of the Athens University of Economics and Business the "grit scale dataset" is to be analyzed.
The online questionnaire data originates from the study "Development and Validation of the Short Grit Scale (Grit-S)" of @duckworth2009development and comprises questions measuring the different International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) personality characteristics as well as demographic data of the participants.
This report focuses on the dimension Openness with the goal to explore its relationships to the other variables using a linear model.
Openness is characterized by a strong agreement to statements like "I have a vivid imagination" or "I am full of ideas", but also "I use difficult words".

In the following, Section \@ref(grit-scale-dataset) gives a detailed overview of all available items as well as a description on how the aggregated variables Eloquence and Openness are formed.
Afterwards Section \@ref(pairwise-associations-with-openness) explores the pairwise associations of the Openness score with the Eloquence score and the demographic data.
Lastly, Section \@ref(linear-model-with-smooth-effect) describes the analysis of the Openness score dependent on the other variables via a linear model, where model selection is performed using a complete search of the model space according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC).

# Modeling of the openness score

## Grit Scale Dataset

### Overview

The "grit scale data" consists of various measurements on 4270 individuals.
After preparing the dataset according to the assignment, there are 22 distinct variables.
They can be divided into 8 automatically collected technical information about the device used to complete the questionnaire, 12 personal details about the subject and two generated scores, eloquence and openness, which are described in Sections \@ref(eloquence-score) and \@ref(openness-score), respectively. \
While all 12 personal details (education, urban, gender, native language English, age, hand, religion, orientation, race, voted, married, family size) are considered, the technical information is only used to exclude unrealistic observations.
Because the average person took about 10 minutes to fill out the Big Five personality test (2.5% quantile: 113 seconds, 97.5% quantile: 930 seconds), 8 observations are excluded, where individuals finished the test in under a minute.
This indicates that their questions are probably poorly answered. \
In the search for the best model according to the AIC additional `r nrow(dt_bigf) - nrow(na.omit(dt_bigf, cols = c(vars_full, "openness")))` observations are discarded because of missing values.
The final model uses all observations that are complete with regard to the included covariates ($n =$ `r nrow(na.omit(dt_bigf, cols = c(res[1, vars][[1]], "openness")))`).

### Eloquence score

During the course of the questionnaire, participants where given a list of 16 words, three of which were not real, and tasked to mark all the words whose definitions they were sure to know.
In order to consider this in the analysis, the variables are aggregated to a single score via the sum of correct answers.
Because the questionnaire only had one box for each item, ticked meaning "I know the definition", it is assumed there are no missing observations for this set of items, which non the less could be the case, because an unchecked box could mean both.

Figure \@ref(fig:plot-eloquence) displays a barchart of the score.

```{r plot-eloquence, include=TRUE, fig.cap='(ref:plot-eloquence)'}

p <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(x = eloquence)) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  geom_function(fun = pnorm, args = dnorm_args(dt_bigf$eloquence), color = "red")
```

### Openness score

<!-- TODO: Mention somewhere this is going to be the response -->

In order to asses the openness of an individual (in terms of the Big Five personality dimensions) ten questions were asked, which are to be aggregated into a single score.
Its calculation is a bit more involved compared to the eloquence score.

1) The openness items are measured on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (Disagree strongly) to 4 (Agree strongly).
1) There is the option to not answer the question.
1) Questions 2, 4 and 6 are formulated in a way that a higher number indicates a lower openness.
   This shows up in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-openness-items), which depicts the correlation of the individual openness items.
   For these measures $4 - x_\text{O}$ is considered.

```{r plot-openness-items, include=TRUE, fig.cap='(ref:plot-openness-items)'}
cowplot::plot_grid(p_corr1, p_corr2)
```
(ref:plot-openness-items) Pairwise Pearson correlations of items testing the Big Five personality dimension "openness" before and after transforming items 2, 4 and 6.

Taking into account these points, the item scores are summed up and divided by four times the number of items answered.
This results in a pseudo continuous score ranging from zero to one, with 60 unique values.
The associated histogram is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-openness).
Possible scores are multiples of $\frac{1}{40}$ (all ten openness items completed), $\frac{1}{36}$ (nine openness items completed), $\frac{1}{32}$ and so on.

```{r plot-openness, include=TRUE, fig.cap='(ref:plot-openness)'}
p <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(x = openness)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), breaks = seq(0, 1, length = 200), color = "#606161",
                 fill = "#606161") +
  geom_function(fun = dnorm, args = dnorm_args(dt_bigf$openness), color = "#0075be", size = 1) +
  geom_density(size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Openness score", y = "Density")
p
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(x = openness)) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  geom_function(fun = pnorm, args = dnorm_args(dt_bigf$openness), color = "red")

p <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(sample = openness)) +

```

## Pairwise associations with openness

### Continuous

* Eloquence makes sense.
* There should be no correlation with age.
* Figure \@ref(fig:openness-continuous)

p1 <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(x = eloquence, y = openness)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.3, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(color = "#0075be", size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Eloquence score", y = "Openness score")

p2 <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(x = age, y = openness)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.3, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(color = "#0075be", size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Openness score")

p3 <- ggplot(dt_bigf[familysize < 20,], aes(x = familysize, y = openness)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.3, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(color = "#0075be", size = 1) +

```

```{r}
# TODO: remove
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
```

## Linear model with smooth effect

* TODO: try centering data
* TODO: don't forget outlier
* TODO: choose a nice reference category
* No need for checking correlation between covariates: exhaustive model selection (variables that don't add new information are dropped)
* Variable selection: Use BIC or else nothing gets filtered
* Search complete model space, because I can

To model the openness score all variables are potentially included.
Because of the Figures pertaining to age and eloquence, the effects are models smoothly.
The final model is selected via a complete search of the model space and using the model with the lowest BIC.
BIC, because I don't want to interpret so many coefficients.
