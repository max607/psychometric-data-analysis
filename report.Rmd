The Big Five personality dimensions are a well known concept from the field of psychology.
They are Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness. \
As part of the Data Analysis course of the Athens University of Economics and Business the "grit scale dataset" is to be analyzed.
The online questionnaire data originates from the study "Development and Validation of the Short Grit Scale (Grit-S)" of @duckworth2009development and comprises questions measuring the different International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) personality characteristics as well as demographic data of the participants.
This report focuses on the dimension Openness with the goal to explore its relationships to the other variables using a linear model.
Openness is characterized by a strong agreement to statements like "I have a vivid imagination" or "I am full of ideas", but also "I use difficult words".

In the following, Section \@ref(grit-scale-dataset) gives a detailed overview of all available items as well as a description on how the aggregated variables Eloquence and Openness are formed.
Afterwards Section \@ref(pairwise-associations-with-openness) explores the pairwise associations of the Openness score with the Eloquence score and the demographic data.
Lastly, Section \@ref(linear-model-with-smooth-effect) describes the analysis of the Openness score dependent on the other variables via a linear model, where model selection is performed using a complete search of the model space according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC).

# Modeling of the Openness score

## Grit Scale Dataset

### Overview

The "grit scale data" consists of various measurements on 4270 individuals.
After preparing the dataset according to the assignment, there are 22 distinct variables.
They can be divided into 8 automatically collected technical information about the device used to complete the questionnaire, 12 personal details about the subject and two generated scores, Eloquence and Openness, which are described in Sections \@ref(eloquence-score) and \@ref(openness-score), respectively. \
While all 12 personal details (age, dominant hand, education, family size, gender, marital status, native language English (yes/no), race, religion, sexual orientation, type of area in childhood, voted in a national election past year) are considered in the analysis, the technical information (browser type, duration of completion of questionnaire parts (3), ISO country code, operating system, screen size (height and width)) is only used to exclude unrealistic observations.
In this regard 8 observations discarded, where the Big Five personality test was finished in under a minute.
This is most likely too short, compared to an average completion time of about 10 minutes (2.5% quantile: 113 seconds, 97.5% quantile: 930 seconds).

During the search for the AIC optimal model, additional `r nrow(dt_bigf) - nrow(na.omit(dt_bigf, cols = c(vars_full, "openness")))` observations are discarded because of missing values.
The final model uses all observations that are complete with regard to the selected covariates ($n =$ `r nrow(na.omit(dt_bigf, cols = c(res[1, vars][[1]], "openness")))`).

### Eloquence score

In the questionnaire, participants where given a list of 16 words, three of which were not real, and tasked to mark all the words whose definitions they were sure to know.
Because the actual words are of low interest, the models consider these variables as an aggregated score, which is the sum of "correct" answers.
"Correct" either means the participant was sure to know the words definition or correctly left the box of a made up word unticked. \
Because the questionnaire only had one box for each item, it is assumed there are no missing observations, even though an unchecked box could be the sign of an unanswered question or an unknown definition.

The resulting score lives on a scale from 0 to 16 and is displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-eloquence).
The barplot has its mode at 12 correct answers and appears pretty symmetrical.
`r nrow(dt_bigf[eloquence < 4,])` have a score below four.
They are not excluded from further analysis, because there is no apparent reason.

```{r plot-eloquence, include=TRUE, fig.cap='(ref:plot-eloquence)'}
p <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(x = eloquence)) +
  geom_bar(color = "#606161", fill = "#606161") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 16, 4)) +
  labs(x = "Eloquence score", y = "Number of observations")
p
```
(ref:plot-eloquence) Barplot illustrating the empirical distribution of the Eloquence score. It shows the number of study participants by number of correctly marked boxes in a checklist about the definitions of words.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(x = eloquence)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), breaks = seq(0, 1, length = 200),
                 color = "black", fill = "white") +
  geom_density() +
  geom_function(fun = dnorm, args = dnorm_args(dt_bigf$eloquence), color = "red")

p <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(x = eloquence)) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  geom_function(fun = pnorm, args = dnorm_args(dt_bigf$eloquence), color = "red")
```

### Openness score

In order to asses the Openness of an individual (in terms of the Big Five personality dimensions) ten questions were asked, which are to be aggregated into a single score.
Its calculation is a bit more involved compared to the Eloquence score.

1) The Openness items are measured on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (Disagree strongly) to 4 (Agree strongly).
1) There is the option to not answer the question.
1) Questions 2, 4 and 6 are formulated in a way that a higher number indicates a lower Openness.
   This can be seen in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-openness-items), which depicts the pairwise Pearson correlations of the individual Openness items.
   The mentioned items correlate positively with each other, but negatively with the rest.
   After transforming these measures using $X^*_\text{O} = 4 - X_\text{O}$ all items are positively correlated.

```{r plot-openness-items, include=TRUE, fig.cap='(ref:plot-openness-items)'}
cowplot::plot_grid(p_corr1, p_corr2)
```
(ref:plot-openness-items) Pairwise Pearson correlations of items testing the Big Five personality dimension "Openness" before and after transforming items 2, 4 and 6.

Taking these points into account, the single items are summed up and divided by four times the number of items answered.
This results in a pseudo continuous score ranging from zero to one, with `r dt_bigf[, length(unique(openness))]` unique values.
The associated histogram is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-openness).
Possible scores are multiples of $\frac{1}{40}$ (all ten openness items completed), $\frac{1}{36}$ (nine Openness items completed), $\frac{1}{32}$ and so on.
Additionally, the density of a normal distribution with equal mean and variance as the Openness score is drawn in blue, next to a density estimate using Silverman's "rule of thumb" [@silverman1986density].

```{r plot-openness, include=TRUE, fig.cap='(ref:plot-openness)'}
p <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(x = openness)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), breaks = seq(0, 1, length = 200), color = "#606161",
                 fill = "#606161") +
  geom_function(fun = dnorm, args = dnorm_args(dt_bigf$openness), color = "#0075be", size = 1) +
  geom_density(size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Openness score", y = "Density")
p
```
(ref:plot-openness) Histogram of pseudo continuous Openness score. Additionally, the density of a normal distribution with equal mean and variance as the Openness score is drawn in blue, next to a density estimate using Silverman's "rule of thumb" [@silverman1986density].

```{r}
p <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(x = openness)) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  geom_function(fun = pnorm, args = dnorm_args(dt_bigf$openness), color = "red")

p <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(sample = openness)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line()
```

## Pairwise associations with Openness

### Continuous

The pairwise association of Openness with numeric covariates is visualized in Figure \@ref(fig:openness-continuous).
There are scatterplots for the Eloquence score, age and number of children of the mother (family size).
Each with a smooth effect (cubic regression spline, ten knots) for better recognition of effects.
There is an effect visible for all three covariates.
The Openness either decreases or is independent of Eloquence until a score of about nine and then increases linearly.
Because of its non-linear character Eloquence is later modeled as a smooth effect, too. \
For the age of an individual, it is more difficult to discern a trend in the Openness score.
It increases slightly with age in general, but has a bump around the age of 30.
This covariate will be considered as a smooth effect, too. \
In the third plot Openness seems to decrease linearly with family size.

```{r openness-continuous, include=TRUE, fig.cap='(ref:openness-eloquence)'}
library(mgcv)

p1 <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(x = eloquence, y = openness)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.3, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = gam, formula = y ~ s(x, bs = 'cr', k = 10), color = "#0075be", size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Eloquence score", y = "Openness score")

p2 <- ggplot(dt_bigf, aes(x = age, y = openness)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.3, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = gam, formula = y ~ s(x, bs = 'cr', k = 10), color = "#0075be", size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Openness score")

p3 <- ggplot(dt_bigf[familysize < 20,], aes(x = familysize, y = openness)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.3, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = gam, formula = y ~ s(x, bs = 'cr', k = 10), color = "#0075be", size = 1) +
  labs(x = "Family size", y = "Openness score")

cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, nrow = 2)
```
(ref:openness-eloquence) The pairwise association of Openness with numeric covariates. Additionally, smooth effects are added to highlight trends in the data. Eloquence and age seem to affect Openness non-linearly.

### Discrete

All discrete covariates will be modeled using dummy encoding.
Table \@ref(tab:openness-discrete) lists the median, mean and standard deviation of the Openness score by the levels of the variable.
Also the share of missing values in the Openness score is displayed.
Throughout it is very low.
Observations with missing values are dropped for the linear model, but Table \@ref(tab:openness-discrete) still includes the statistics for "not answered" (NA), to make sure values are not missing systematically.
Indeed, some missing values are of concern.
E.g., the "category" NA for religion, with 59 observations, has the lowest average Openness of all levels.
Nonetheless, these are only `r dt_bigf[, sum(is.na(religion)) / .N] %>% scales::percent(accuracy = 0.1)`.

```{r openness-discrete, include=TRUE}
f_measurements <- function(dt, var) {
  n_na <- sum(is.na(dt[, .SD, .SDcols = var]))
  dt[, .(mean = mean(openness, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(openness, na.rm = TRUE),
         median = median(openness, na.rm = TRUE),
         NAs_O = scales::percent(sum(is.na(openness)) / .N, accuracy = 0.01)), by = var] %>%
    setnames(old = var, new = "level") %>%
    .[is.na(level), level := paste0("NA (", n_na, ")")] %>%
    .[, covariate := var] %>%
    .[]
}

dt_tab <- c("education", "urban", "gender", "engnat", "hand", "religion", "orientation", "race",
            "voted", "married") %>%
  lapply(f_measurements, dt = dt_bigf) %>%
  do.call(what = rbind) %>%
  setcolorder(c("covariate", "level", "median", "mean", "sd", "NAs_O")) %>%
  .[, covariate := tools::toTitleCase(covariate)] %>%
  setnames(c("Covariate", "Level", "Median", "Mean", "SD", "Share NAs"))

knitr::kable(cbind(dt_tab[1:26,], dt_tab[27:52,]), digits = 2, booktabs = TRUE, longtable = TRUE,
             caption = "Pairwise associations with Openness score and discrete variables.") %>%
  kableExtra::collapse_rows(columns = c(1, 7), latex_hline = "major", valign = "top") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "repeat_header", font_size = 8) %>%
  kableExtra::column_spec(6, border_right = TRUE)
```

## Linear model with smooth effect

The Openness score is modeled conditional to the rest of covariates.
Because there is no theoretical framework explored in this analysis, the focus for this exploratory model is on prediction.
This is why variables are selected using the AIC.
After model selection the best model is

\begin{equation}
  Y_{\text{Openness}, i} \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma),
\end{equation}

where $\mu$ depends on age, dominant hand, education, family size, gender, native language English (yes/no), race, religion, sexual orientation, voted in a national election past year and Eloquence.

```{r inclusion-probs, include=TRUE}
res[, sapply(vars_full, function(var) sum(sapply(vars, `%in%`, x = var) * probs))] %>%
  scales::percent() %>%
  data.table(Covariate = names(.) %>% tools::toTitleCase(), "Inclusion probability" = .) %>%
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Inclusion probabilities according to AIC.")
```

It is found searching the complete model space, which is possible due to the relatively small amount of covariates.
Table \@ref(tab:inclusion-probs) lists all posterior inclusion probabilities under AIC.

```{r summary, include=TRUE}
summary(m.lam.fin)
plot(m.lam.fin)
```

I will just leave you with the model output because I have no time left.

# Conclusion

While no mayor effect on Openness was found, it was clearly possible to improve on a simple intercept model.
In all models considered, especially the Eloquence score was of importance, which is reasonable, considering a large part of Openness is related to words.
